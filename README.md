# New You

--- WORK IN PROGRESS ---

This project I'm currently working on is first and foremost aimed at getting a basic understanding of Laravel.
As nutrition is a personal interest of mine, I was inspired by the popular MyFitnessPal app and I decided to create my own version of it.

I've been trying to design this project according to the MVC model, using the lessons over at Laracasts as guidance.
This project is meant to reflect most of what I've learned over the past half year, including CRUD, authentication, as well as basic frontend skills: JavaScript, jQuery and CSS frameworks (TailwindCSS in this case).

As this is still work in progress, I have included some screenshots for now, but a deploy will soon follow.
