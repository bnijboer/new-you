# New You


**URL:**

[New You](http://phplaravel-481691-1516217.cloudwaysapps.com/).




**Aim:**

This is my first Laravel web app. Since nutrition is a personal interest of mine, I was inspired by the popular MyFitnessPal app and I decided to create my own version of it.
I made this app with the aim of getting familiar with Laravel and backend development in general.

This project is meant to reflect most of what I've learned over the past half year, including CRUD, authentication, as well as basic frontend skills in JavaScript/jQuery, responsive design and using CSS frameworks (TailwindCSS in this case).




**Description:**

With this app, users can log their food intake and monitor the amount of calories and nutrients they consume.
By using the *diet* feature, a user can set a *weight goal*, to which the app will calculate how long users will need to consume a certain number of calories/nutrients in order to achieve that goal.




**Languages/systems/frameworks used:**

- Laravel/PHP
- JavaScript/jQuery/Vue.js
- CSS/TailwindCSS
- MySQL
